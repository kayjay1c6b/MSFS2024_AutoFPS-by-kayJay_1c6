**About This App**  
This app was created to ensure continued access to the functionalities of the original Auto FPS app after its developer, reset_xpdr, announced they would no longer be developing it. My goal was to adapt the app for compatibility with the new 2024 SIM version and provide the community with an updated solution.  

Initially, I worked independently to make the app functional, but later collaborated with the original developer to ensure proper integration. While reset_xpdr expressed interest in updating their app for compatibility, they stated they would not be adding new features and directed users to my app for improvements.  

Over time, my version introduced enhancements, particularly in VR functionality, which led to some confusion in the community about which app to use. The original developer clarified that users could stick with their version for the original experience or use my app for additional features.  

Recently, I’ve noticed that reset_xpdr's app has incorporated some new ideas and is now actively being developed, despite their earlier statement. To avoid unnecessary competition and confusion, and to focus on my growing family (my 3-month-old son, who has become my top priority) I’ve decided to stop developing my app, as it is no longer needed.  

This repository remains as a reference for those interested in the history of the project or the improvements made during its development.  

Thank you to everyone who supported this effort!
